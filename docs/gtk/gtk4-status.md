# wxGTK4 build status (tracked checklist)

This is the Phase 1 deliverable referenced by `docs/gtk/gtk4-port-plan.md`:
a compiler-verified inventory of what actually breaks when building against
real GTK4 headers, superseding the grep-based estimate in that document's
§3. Update this file as items get fixed; it's meant to be the running
source of truth, not a one-time report.

## How this was produced

```
./configure --with-gtk=4 --disable-shared --without-opengl \
            --disable-optimise --disable-stc --disable-tests \
            --disable-uiactionsim
make -k -j4
```
Environment: Ubuntu 24.04, `libgtk-4-dev` 4.14.5, `libgtk-3-dev` 3.24.41
(both installed side by side; wx picks GTK4 via pkg-config `gtk4`).
`configure` succeeds cleanly and reports "Which GUI toolkit should
wxWidgets use? GTK+ 4" — the configure/build-system integration is fine.
`make -k` (keep-going) was used to surface every independent failure in
one pass rather than stopping at the first one.

## Headline finding

**This is not ~80 unrelated bugs. It is a small number of removed GTK3
APIs whose absence cascades through nearly the whole `src/gtk` tree**,
because the affected calls sit in widely-shared code
(`wxGetTopLevelGDK()` in `window.cpp`, `wxWindowGTK`'s base class in
`window.h`, generic container/child helpers). A clean `make -k -j4`
against GTK4 4.14 headers produces:

- **1304** `error:` diagnostics
- across **~80** distinct `.cpp`/`.h` translation units in `src/gtk`,
  `src/generic`, `src/aui`, `src/common`, `include/wx/gtk`
- essentially the *entire* GTK-specific core library fails to compile —
  only a handful of backend-agnostic files (netlib, baselib) build clean.

This means the ~95 existing `__WXGTK4__` conditionals in the tree (see
`gtk4-port-plan.md` §1) have **never been exercised against real GTK4
headers in this state** — they're necessary but nowhere near sufficient.
Treat "wxGTK4 already partially works" as false until this list is empty.

## Root-cause categories, by error volume

Deduplicated from the 1304 diagnostics, by the specific removed
identifier:

| Removed/changed API | Occurrences | GTK4 replacement | Plan phase |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `GTK_CONTAINER`, `gtk_container_add`, `gtk_container_remove` | 69 | `gtk_widget_set_parent`/widget-specific setters (no generic container) | Phase 2/5 |
| `GTK_BIN`, `gtk_bin_get_child` | 34 | widget-specific child accessors (`gtk_button_get_child`, etc.) — `GtkBin` removed entirely | Phase 2/5 |
| `gtk_widget_get_window` | 33 | none direct — only realized toplevels have a surface (`gtk_native_get_surface`); ordinary widgets have no window | **Phase 2 (the hard one)** |
| `gtk_widget_destroy` | 19 | implicit via `g_object_unref`/`gtk_window_destroy` — no generic widget destroy call | Phase 2/5 |
| `gtk_box_pack_start`, `gtk_box_pack_end` | 20 | `gtk_box_append`, `gtk_box_prepend` (no start/end distinction) | Phase 5 (mechanical) |
| `gdk_window_get_display` and other `gdk_window_*` | 10+ | `gdk_surface_get_display` etc. — `GdkWindow` type doesn't exist in GTK4 headers at all (0 hits found in `/usr/include/gtk-4.0/gdk/*.h`) | **Phase 2 (the hard one)** |
| `gtk_widget_get_toplevel` | 9 | `gtk_widget_get_root` (returns `GtkRoot*`, not `GtkWidget*` — needs a cast/rethink at each call site) | Phase 3 |
| `gtk_selection_data_get_length/target/data`, `gtk_drag_finish` | 22 | `GdkContentProvider`/`GdkContentDeserializer` — full DnD/selection rewrite | Phase 6 |
| `gtk_style_context_get`, `gtk_widget_style_get`, `GtkStateType`, `GTK_STATE_ACTIVE` | 19 | CSS-node-based `GtkStyleContext` state flags (`GtkStateFlags`) — old style-properties API gone | Phase 5 |
| `gtk_file_chooser_get_filename`, `gtk_file_chooser_set_filename` | 11 | GFile-based `gtk_file_chooser_get_file`/`set_file` | Phase 7 |
| `GTK_TOOL_BUTTON`, `GTK_RADIO_BUTTON`, and other deprecated type-check macros | ~10 | GTK4 dropped most `GTK_FOO(x)` cast macros for now-removed/renamed types | Phase 5 |
| `gdk/gdkx.h`, `gdk/gdkwayland.h` (fatal, wrong include path) | 8 files | moved to `gdk/x11/gdkx.h` / `gdk/wayland/gdkwayland.h` (backend-specific subdirs) — path rename is mechanical, but the code behind it still uses removed `GdkWindow` APIs (`GDK_WINDOW_XID` → `gdk_x11_surface_get_xid`), so fixing the `#include` alone does not clear these files | Phase 2 |

Long tail not itemized above (style-context conversions, `gtk_widget_get_preferred_height`
→ `measure()`, misc `-fpermissive` conversion errors) accounts for the
remaining ~150 diagnostics; these mostly resolve automatically once the
categories above are fixed, since they're downstream of the same missing
symbols in shared headers.

## What actually blocks everything else

**Update:** the design work is now done — see
`docs/gtk/gtk4-phase2-window-model-design.md`. Tracing the actual call
sites of `gtk_widget_get_window`/`GdkWindow` (and the ~18 per-widget
`GTKGetWindow()` overrides that depend on it) showed this isn't a single
opaque blocker but six distinct, mostly *easier*-in-GTK4 sub-problems
(display lookup, event-source identity, cursor setting, paint/clip,
Z-order, coordinate translation), none of which require redesigning how
child widgets are positioned — that part (`wxPizza`) already carries over
from GTK3 unchanged. `wxGetTopLevelGDK()` (`src/gtk/window.cpp:478`,
called from `bitmap.cpp`, `cursor.cpp`, `display.cpp`, `evtloop.cpp`,
`taskbar.cpp`, `utilsgtk.cpp`, plus `window.cpp` itself) turns out to be
mostly the "get me a display" pattern with a one-line fix
(`gdk_display_get_default()`), not a sign of deep window-per-widget
coupling. See the design doc for the full breakdown and the two items
that do need a real design/scope decision (`wxPopupWindow`,
`wxNativeContainerWindow`).

## Fixed so far

- [x] `include/wx/gtk/evtloop.h`: `GdkEvent` forward-declared as `union`
  unconditionally; GTK4 declares it `struct`. Fixed with an
  `__WXGTK4__` conditional (commit `e80b8d4`).
- [x] `3rdparty/nanosvg` submodule wasn't checked out locally, causing
  an unrelated `bmpsvg.cpp` failure — environment issue, not a GTK4
  incompatibility; resolved with `git submodule update --init`.

## Not yet attempted (by design)

Everything in the root-cause table above is left for the phases the
port plan assigns them to, rather than being patched piecemeal here.
Fixing `gtk_widget_get_window`/`GdkWindow` call sites without first
deciding the Phase 2 child-positioning model would mean redoing the
work once that design exists — better to design first.
